# GitHub Portfolio

This repository is a personal portfolio used to track my learning, projects, and interests in computer science. It reflects my progress over time and will continue to be updated as I gain more experience and knowledge.

## About Me

Hello, my name is **Bulgan-Erdene Erdenebat**.  
I am a first-year **Computer Science** student.

I am still at an early stage of my learning journey, but I am consistent, motivated, and open to learning new tools, ideas, and technologies. This portfolio helps me document my development and reflect on my progress.

## Current Focus

I am currently focusing on:
- Studying Computer Science at university  
- Learning programming fundamentals  
- Practising problem-solving and logical thinking  

This repository will be updated regularly as I learn new concepts and work on new projects.

## Experience

I previously worked on the **Mongolian localisation of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB)**, where I contributed to adapting game content for Mongolian players. This experience gave me insight into how games are localised and prepared for different regions.

In addition, I have played **Mobile Legends: Bang Bang at a high level**, working within organised teams and competitive environments. Through this experience, I developed teamwork, communication, strategic thinking, and a deeper understanding of game mechanics and competitive gameplay.

These experiences strengthened my interest in the gaming industry and influenced my long-term career goals.
