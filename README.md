# A Bit About Me

I am a first-year Computer Science student at the University of South Wales.  
I also completed my foundation year at USW, which helped me build a strong base before starting my degree.

I am still new to programming and technology, and I do not consider myself an expert. However, I am adaptable, patient, and willing to learn. I like understanding things properly rather than rushing through them.
